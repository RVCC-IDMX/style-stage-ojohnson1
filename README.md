# We Love Teal

This was a last submission project for my WEB Dev II class. In this project I was able to practice and find new skills to curate my own style stage design.
I was able to find a new hover link style. As well as practice creating cards for text content on the page.
Here are a list of features on my page:

- Use ::before and after
- Use mobile first assignment as starting point
- Included a reset/normalize library
- Styling links
- Styling the lists
- Styling the backgrounds
- Using lighthouse to check load times
